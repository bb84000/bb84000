I’m @bb84000

I’m retired and live in Provence.

I write most of my programs as I cannot find applications which meet quite exactly my needs !

I use Lazarus IDE, so, most of the programs published here can be compiled under Linux and Mac, even if I give onliy Windows binaries.

You can (must ?) give me your appreciation and report bugs in the "issues" of the programs

My usual language is french. So, if you wish, you can also make your comments in french.
